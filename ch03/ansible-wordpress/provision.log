ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  found unacceptable key (unhashable type: 'AnsibleMapping')

The error appears to be in '/vagrant/provisioning/playbook.yml': line 39, column 20, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

          - localhost
        password: {{mysql_new_root_password}}
                   ^ here
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:

    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}

Should be written as:

    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"
